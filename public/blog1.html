                What’s Branding? Branding can Simply be referred to as an
                identity that serves as a voice of your brand. It has to do with
                the overall perception of how your users/buyers perceive your
                brand…. Branding is what separate the big dogs in the industry
                and the others. You are probably confused right now thinking,
                but I’ve a logo, and a tagline isn’t that a brand identity. Yhhh
                yiu are right, but branding goes way beyond the logo or just the
                tagline to more of psychological appealing and communication to
                customers using your brand. A speaking brand is a selling
                brand….

                through step by step process of crafting the perfect branding
                for your business.. A branding is the overall identity of what a
                business is, their message that separate them from their
                competitors and how they want their potential customers to view
                them. Also according to Seth Godin, brand is
                <q
                  >the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships
                  that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to
                  choose one product or service over another.</q

                Branding is your identity that connects your customers to your
                product by appealing to their subconscious mind. Gerald Zaltman
                also write that 95% of customer purchasing decisions are
                subconscious..

                  <strong>Create Buyers Persona: </strong> this is the first
                  step in branding your business. this allows you to understand
                  your market audience and also getting informations as to what
                  and how to sell to them. creating a buyers persona enables you
                  to be able to assess your customers closely. buyers persona
                  requires you conduct a market research by engaging with your
                  prospective customers and also sending Q&amp;A either through
                  the traditional means or using social media, emails or any
                  other relevant platforms where your target audience can be
                  found. This approach can greatly help boost your business by
                  establishing a connection with your buyers owing to the fact
                  that the product is originally built with them in mind and
                  they can also resonate with it.

                  <strong>Create a brand story:</strong> this goes to the very
                  reason and existence of your business. a brand story is what
                  solutions your business promise to its customers and why your
                  product is different from your competitors. this brand story
                  is used in crafting a tagline for your business/startup. what
                  is a TAGLINE? A tagline is short phrase or motto that carries
                  your business promise, mission and purpose. this tagline are
                  longlasting and often seen on your products alongside your
                  logo. crafting a perfect tagline for your business is very
                  important because it explains the very purpose of business and
                  its story. here are some top companies brand tagline to lookup

                  <strong>Create your Logo and brand color:</strong> This step
                  will require you outsource to a a professional logo designer
                  to design your logo for you. a logo is simply the face of the
                  brand. and bad logo is definitely what you should avoid.
                  Colors have meanings and your brand color should match the
                  exact mood of your business. Entreprenuers are often tempted
                  to choose their favorite colors as their brand color which is
                  totally wrong.
