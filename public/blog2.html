              <h1 class="post-heading">The Life Blood Of A Business.</h1>
              <p>
                It&#39;s probably not a new thing to know that one of the things
                that keeps humans alive is the blood in our veins. it is what is
                actually keeping our body functioning well, and it as well keeps
                our brain alive. when the body seems to be running short of
                blood, then a person begins to die gradually, and immediately
                there is no blood in the body again, the person dies. life is in
                the blood, so it is very important that you have enough blood to
                regulate the functions of the body. Now this also applies to
                businesses, every business out there, whether big or small needs
                one thing to survive and that is sales.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>sale is the life blood of every business...</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Every business needs to make sales. It is the only way you can
                grow your business, and it is the only way you can get the money
                to keep doing what you are doing.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Sales are important because they help the business stay afloat.
                If there were no sales, then all of your money would go straight
                into the company&#39;s bank account and nothing would get done
                with it. Sales are what pays the bills and keeps your business
                running smoothly. sales is the ultimate goal of any business or
                company, it is wat determine growth and progress of the
                business. It also determines if the company&#39;s product or
                service is accepted by its market. where there&#39;s no sales
                the business begins to die and if this happens over a long time
                then the business would eventually die (fold up)
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                So many small scale business and supposedly big/large companies
                (businesses) mostly find themselves suffering from little or no
                sales at all. This sometimes leads to frustration of the
                business owners, employees and sales team, as there seems to be
                no results for their investment in the business. Any business
                whether large or small can suffer from low sales as there are
                factors responsible for low sales and if this is not tackled, no
                matter how big the investment is, the business is likely to go
                bankrupt if there&#39;s no sales. There are a lot of strategy
                that is responsible for crushing sales in your business or
                company, and this starts from before the company or business is
                created. Having a good sales strategy does not start when the
                product or service is created, it is very important that sales
                strategy is done along side with the business plan/model. when
                this is done, it&#39;s makes it easier for the the sales team to
                convert leads into sales.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here are four things you need to consider if you want to have
                enough sales for your business.

                  customers&#39; interests, habits and behaviors, so that you
                  can learn more about who they are and what they need from your
                  business.
